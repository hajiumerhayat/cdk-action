# CDK Action

Interact with the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) within your Github CI/CD workflow.

## Overview

This action allows you to preform `cdk` commands and recieve formatted output that allow you to enchance your CI/CD workflow logically.

**Driving Factor:**
The driving factor for the creation of this action was the desire to recieve output from the `cdk` command within my workflow without failing the workflow.
While there are other actions available that may provide better markdown formatted comments; they tend to target a specific part of the CI/CD workflow and can't be used for other parts of the CI/CD workflow.

I.E. This action can be used on any trigger, and you can define how the output is handled.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This action **WILL NOT** fail just because cdk returned non-zero.
> To check if cdk returned non-zero check `steps.id.outputs.error == 'true'`

When using this action you will need to have prior steps that:

1) Checkout your code
1) Setup your AWS Credentials
1) Install your dependencies

And steps after this actions to:

1) Create / Update an Issue or PR Comment
1) Fail the job if the `error` output is true
